            Hi, I'm Rachel!  I'm an aspiring designer from San Jose, California. I love sunsets, healthy food, coffee shops, singing, fashion, corgis, and all things creative. My artwork is inspired by finding the life and beauty of all things around me. Using mixed media, photography, digital technology, typography, and an artistic eye, my goal is to create visual messages that touch us and speak to us in new ways.
