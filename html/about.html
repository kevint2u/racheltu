            Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel! I am a teenager from San Jose, California, aspiring to be a designer. I am a senior at Lynbrook High School, and I love sunsets, healthy food, fashion, singing, coffee shops, corgis, and all things creative. My artwork is inspired by the idea that there is life and beauty in all things if they are looked at with different perspectives. Using mixed media, photography, computer programs, typography, and an artistic eye, my goal is to create beautiful things out of nothing.
